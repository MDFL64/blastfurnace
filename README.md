*A bulk crafting utility for Team Fortress 2*

This program simplifies the process of crafting weapons together in Team Fortress 2. It skips items with special qualities and
always leaves at least one of each type of weapon.

*Note:* This program is not intended to give users unfair advantages by helping them get low craft numbers. It only crafts
weapons into scrap. No assistance will be provided to users hoping to use the code for this purpose.

##Building

Run module/compile.bat to build the C++ module. Only tested with MinGW on Windows.

The rest of the project is a VS2013 C# solution and can be compiled with Visual Studio.
